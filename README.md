The story is interesting but is not finished yet.
Me and my friend were enjoying Type Racer (https://play.typeracer.com/) at OOP class. And he offered me to build our own type racer but with monkey-type design. It is obviously a multiplayer, but since we're both into a front-end, there is no way we can write backend and implement websockets that easy. 

I'm gonna finish this README when we will finish. MY BAD. Got some assignments & midterms.
